# gitCommitMiner
A script for generating custom git commit hashes

Please note: this script is mostly a fun joke, I wouldn't recomend running it, it is a waste of time and energy

## Usage:

```
./mineCommit.sh -d4 -j5
```
d is the difficulty: the number of leading zeros that should be in the git hash.  4 is default and should only take a few minutes

j is the number of scripts that will be spawned in parallel
